## ANALYSIS FOR H3N2 HA RBS DEEP MUTATIONAL SCANNING EXPERIMENTS
This study aims to examine the mechanistic basis of entrenchment of E190D substitution during human H3N2 evolution. Three sets of deep mutational scanning experiment were performed:
  1. Combinatorial mutant library of reversions from A/Brisbane/10/2007 to A/Wyoming/3/2003
  2. Combinatorial mutant library of reversions from A/Brisbane/10/2007 rev6 mutant to A/Moscow/10/1999
  3. Triple mutant libraries (residues 225, 226, and 228):
    * A/Hong Kong/1/1968 WT
    * A/Hong Kong/1/1968 E190D
    * A/Victoria/361/2011 WT
    * A/Victoria/361/2011 D190E
